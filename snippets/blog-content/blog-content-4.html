        The First World War broke out little more than a decade after man's
        first sustained powered heavier-than-air flight, and nobody would fly
        across the Atlantic in one go until after it was over.
      </p>
      <p>
        None the less, WW1 saw some fascinating and charismatic aircraft,
        including the first of the fighter aircraft (once people worked out that
        firing revolvers at each other from aircraft wasn't terribly effective,
        at least if you preferred not to run out of fuel before you hit
        anything); amongst the more famous on the German side were the legendary
        Fokkers.

        We've just received stock of Eduard's rather nice 1/48 scale model kits,
        including the Dr.I&nbsp;<em>Dreidecker</em> (German for 'triplane') made
        famous by Manfred von Richthofen - the 'Red Baron'.
