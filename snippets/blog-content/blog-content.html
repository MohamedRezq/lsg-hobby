      <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reserve products in advance</li>
        <li>
          Receive promotional prices on select products during the reservation
          period
        </li>
        <li>No upfront payment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Why are we introducing this Reservation system?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We have heard our customers' frustration that some products sell out
          too quickly
        </li>
        <li>
          We have also received feedback about wanting better visibility into
          product arrival dates
        </li>
        <li>
          This system addresses both - it allows our customers to reserve
          products in advance and be informed of their arrival dates
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>When are you launching this?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is live now. Click on
          <a href="/reserve/reservations">Reserve</a>&nbsp;in the menu.
        </li>
        <li>We will continue to make improvements over the coming months</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Submit your reservations prior to the PO's close date at midnight
          (Eastern Time)
        </li>
        <li>Priority will be given to customers who have reservations</li>
        <li>
          Remaining inventory will be allocated on a first come first serve
          basis
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>How do I reserve products?</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Go to <a href="/reserve/reservations">Reserve</a> to see the current
          list of available POs&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          Click into the PO number to view the products that you can reserve
        </li>
        <li>Update the quantities of the products you wish to reserve</li>
        <li>Review your reservation</li>
        <li>Reserve your products</li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>What does a "Pending" Order Status mean?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your reservation or changes to your reservation has NOT been submitted
          and confirmed by our system
        </li>
        <li>Ensure that you submit your reservation prior to the close date</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>What does a "Submitted" Order Status mean?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>We have received and confirmed your reservation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Can I change my reservation</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Yes, changes to your reservations can be made until midnight (Eastern
          Time) of the close date
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>What happens past the close date?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reservations are locked, no additional changes can be made</li>
        <li>No new reservations can be submitted on that PO</li>
        <li>
          Promotional prices, if any, will not be valid past the cut-off date
        </li>
        <li>
          Orders submitted outside of the reservation system will be available
          on a first come first serve basis, similar to how we currently
          distribute our products
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Am I guaranteed the items I reserve?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We will make our best effort to reserve your products, however, there
          may be situations beyond our control that could affect your
          reservations
        </li>
        <li>
          We will send notifications in advance if there are changes to your
          reservation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Do I have to pay up front to reserve products?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>No, you do not have to pay up front to reserve products</li>
        <li>
          When products you reserve arrive, you must honour your reservations
          and purchase them
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Customers who abuse our reservation system will have their
            reservation privileges revoked or account terminated</strong
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Can I cancel items that I have reserved?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can update / cancel your reservations <strong>before</strong> the
          close date
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >After the reservation's close date, you must honour your
            reservations</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Customers who abuse our reservation system will have their
            reservation privileges revoked or account terminated</strong
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>How do I check my reservations and their arrival dates?</strong>
      </p>

        <li>
          Select the month from the calendar along the top to see the products

        </li>
        <li>
          The order number for all reservations will start with
          "<strong>LP</strong>"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>How accurate is your ETA?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We try to be as accurate as possible based on historical lead times
          with our vendors
        </li>
        <li>We will send out notifications if there is a change in ETA</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >What does early / late &lt;month&gt; mean (ie. late May)?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Early = first half of the month</li>
        <li>Late = last half of the month</li>
      </ul>

        <li>
          No, we will accept reservations and continue to stock products in our
          warehouse
        </li>
        <li>
          We encourage our customers to reserve their products in advance to
          ensure they receive what they order
        </li>
        <li>
          Not everything will be on our reservation system - we love to surprise
          our customers with new products
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>What notifications will I receive?</strong></p>

        <li>
          If you made a reservation, a reminder will be sent 2 days before the
          close date, in case you wish to make any updates
        </li>
        <li>
          If the reservation status of your product has changed (ie, cancelled,
          re-added)
        </li>
        <li>If the ETA date has changed</li>
      </ul>
