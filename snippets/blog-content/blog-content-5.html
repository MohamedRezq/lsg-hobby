        MF Ghost is a sequel to the much-loved Initial D, and is set in a near
        future where self-driving EVs have largely supplanted the old ICE
        technology. Street racers continue to compete with ICE cars however, and
        this is where the story begins.

        This first upcoming release from Aoshima is of the car driven by the
        series' protagonist, one Kanata Katagiri. Fair play - this does look
        pretty cool!

        you know as soon as we find out more...
